This is The Odin Project's Etch a Sketch project assignment

What' this program do:

This program is browser version of Etch a Sketch. User can select
square size and draw inside of sketch pad when hovering 

TODO:

- Instead of hovering to draw inside sketch add click to draw
- Add clear sketch feature
- Rather than a simple color change from black to white, 
  each interaction should randomize the squareâ€™s RGB value entirely
